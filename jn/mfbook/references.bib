This framework unifies the existing approaches of causal ordering in the literature. On the basis of locally imposed directions of causality (derived from the underlying economic theory) global causal dependencies can be derived for the whole model. The result is a graphical representation of the causal dependencies of the model, called a signed causal-ordering graph. On the basis of a small example taken from the area of public finance, it is pointed out what kind of conclusions can be drawn from the signed causal-ordering graph. The conclusions of this kind of qualitative analysis can be viewed as a hypothesis which requires subsequent empirical analysis in order to see if the hypothesis can be rejected. © 1995.},

The model, with more than 20,000 equations, is solved by nesting a Jacobi iteration procedure with a combined Gauss- Seidel and Newton-Raphson procedure. The so lution performance, in terms of elapsed time, can be improved almost proportionally to the number of parallel processors. One can take advantage of vector processing at several stages of the solution algorithm. By exploiting the dynamics of the model, it is possible to gain a factor of 2 or more in speed from vectorization.

	abstract = {Newton's Method is an important algorithm for solving nonlinear systems of equations. For any solution algorithm, the principle concerns are robustness (finding a solution reliably) and efficiency (finding a solution quickly). Newton is simple in principle, but a useful implementation must deal with a variety of practical and theoretical obstacles.By using partial derivatives, Newton's Method can model the shape of the residual surface to provide quadratic convergence near the solution: the number of correct digits doubles each iteration. But far from the solution, the full Newton step may go too far, leading to divergence or oscillation. Or the full step may be illegal, leading to economic nonsense like negative prices and numerical problems like taking the log of a negative number. Automatic damping – taking shorter steps along the Newton direction – can improve global convergence in such cases.The most expensive part of Newton's Method is factoring the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian can be very large in contemporary macroeconometric models, particularly forward-looking models that introduce simultaneity across time periods as well as between equations. Newton is impractical for such large models unless it can exploit the sparsity of the Jacobian. Sparse direct methods can be applied to the entire Jacobian; one advantage of direct methods is that after the first iteration, subsequent factorings can be extremely fast. An alternative is iterative Krylov subspace methods; their small memory requirements are an advantage, but they may fail to converge. In the case of forward-looking models, the stacked Jacobian has a block band-diagonal structure that can be exploited by direct methods or for preconditioning iterative methods.his paper describes enhancements to Newton's Method used in the TROLL modeling system and illustrates them with a variety of contemporary models.},

	abstract = {As the effects of climate change become increasingly evident, the design and implementation of climate-aware policies have assumed a more central role in the macroeconomic policy debate. With this has come an increasing recognition of the importance of introducing climate into the economic policy making tools used by central economic policy making agencies (such as ministries of finance and ministries of planning). This paper integrates climate outcomes into a macro-structural model for Pakistan, the kind of model that is suitable for use on a regular basis by ministry staff. The model includes the standard set of variables and economic logic that are necessary for the kinds of forecasting, economic policy, and budgetary planning analysis typically conducted by central ministries. In addition to standard outputs (unemployment, inflation, gross domestic product growth, and fiscal and current accounts), the model generates climate outcomes (tons of carbon emitted and economic and health damages due to higher temperatures and pollution). These outcomes are generated when specific climate policies such as mitigation are analyzed, but also when other policies are analyzed that might have unanticipated climate impacts. The paper describes the changes made to the World Bank’s standard macro structural model, MFMod, in integrated climate outcomes, climate policies, and the economic impacts of climate on Pakistan’s economy. Notably, carbon-tax scenarios show that a \$20 carbon tax can reduce emissions in Pakistan by 36 percent by 2050. Gross domestic product impacts could also be positive, if the revenues from the carbon tax were used to reduce reliance on heavily distorting taxes. The model also quantifies associated co-benefits from reduced local air pollution and better health and productivity outcomes. In the absence of action to restrain climate change, the model suggests that increased temperatures and rain variability could reduce output by as much as 10 percent compared with a scenario where global temperature rises were minimized.},

This approach is preferred to pure calibration or Bayesian estimation, because the functional forms imposed in the panel are consistent with those used in the macro structural model.},

    abstract = {This issue of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy is the second in the Rebuilding Macroeconomic Theory project. The papers in the first issue proposed specific improvements to the New-Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (NK-DSGE) framework, in response to the events of the 2008 crisis. This issue goes further. We, as editors, now argue that a new multiple-equilibrium and diverse (MEADE) paradigm is needed for macroeconomics. It will emphasize that economies can have more than one stable outcome, and study why. It will require using both toy models, which enable a quick, first-pass, intuitive understanding of a question, and policy models (aka structural economic models) which develop a detailed empirical understanding of the economy. We argue that the seminal IS/LM, Solow–Swan, Ramsey, Real Business Cycle, Taylor, and Clarida/Galí/Gertler models have all been toys, as is the benchmark NK-DSGE model. In the past the models have adapted as the questions changed, and the NK-DSGE model must now do this since it has failed to capture both the salient aspects of the lead-up to the 2008 crisis and the slow recovery afterwards. The way forward in the MEADE paradigm will be to start with simple models, ideally two-dimensional sketches, that explain mechanisms that can cause multiple equilibria. These mechanisms should then be incorporated into larger DSGE models in a new, multiple-equilibrium synthesis. All of this will need to be informed by closer fidelity to the data, drawing on lessons obtained from detailed work on policy models.},

Each model has a similar structure and functional form, with variation reflecting data availability and economic specialization (notably for oil exporters). Although the functional forms are similar, the parameters are country specific and estimated at the country level. Forecasts across countries are live-linked, with the export market growth of each country calculated as a trade-weighted average of imports of each of its trading partners. Remittance inflows and outflows are balanced across countries through a similar mechanism. Other cross-country linkages come through the real effective exchange rate and export and import prices, which are a function of world commodity prices and local cost considerations.},

This report de scribes the fast solution methods encompassed by Project LINK, including implementation on an IBM 3090-200VF supercomputer. LINK comprises 79 macroeconometric models emulating the economies of countries or regions linked through international trade. The model, with more than 20,000 equations, is solved by nesting a Jacobi iteration procedure with a combined Gauss- Seidel and Newton-Raphson procedure. The so lution performance, in terms of elapsed time, can be improved almost proportionally to the number of parallel processors. One can take advantage of vector processing at several stages of the solution algorithm. By exploiting the dynamics of the model, it is possible to gain a factor of 2 or more in speed from vectorization. Furthermore, the availability of large computer memory has significantly reduced the time spent on disk input/output. © 1987, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Newton's Method is an important algorithm for solving nonlinear systems of equations. For any solution algorithm, the principle concerns are robustness (finding a solution reliably) and efficiency (finding a solution quickly). Newton is simple in principle, but a useful implementation must deal with a variety of practical and theoretical obstacles.By using partial derivatives, Newton's Method can model the shape of the residual surface to provide quadratic convergence near the solution: the number of correct digits doubles each iteration. But far from the solution, the full Newton step may go too far, leading to divergence or oscillation. Or the full step may be illegal, leading to economic nonsense like negative prices and numerical problems like taking the log of a negative number. Automatic damping – taking shorter steps along the Newton direction – can improve global convergence in such cases.The most expensive part of Newton's Method is factoring the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian can be very large in contemporary macroeconometric models, particularly forward-looking models that introduce simultaneity across time periods as well as between equations. Newton is impractical for such large models unless it can exploit the sparsity of the Jacobian. Sparse direct methods can be applied to the entire Jacobian; one advantage of direct methods is that after the first iteration, subsequent factorings can be extremely fast. An alternative is iterative Krylov subspace methods; their small memory requirements are an advantage, but they may fail to converge. In the case of forward-looking models, the stacked Jacobian has a block band-diagonal structure that can be exploited by direct methods or for preconditioning iterative methods.his paper describes enhancements to Newton's Method used in the TROLL modeling system and illustrates them with a variety of contemporary models.},

	abstract = {As the effects of climate change become increasingly evident, the design and implementation of climate-aware policies have assumed a more central role in the macroeconomic policy debate. With this has come an increasing recognition of the importance of introducing climate into the economic policy making tools used by central economic policy making agencies (such as ministries of finance and ministries of planning). This paper integrates climate outcomes into a macro-structural model for Pakistan, the kind of model that is suitable for use on a regular basis by ministry staff. The model includes the standard set of variables and economic logic that are necessary for the kinds of forecasting, economic policy, and budgetary planning analysis typically conducted by central ministries. In addition to standard outputs (unemployment, inflation, gross domestic product growth, and fiscal and current accounts), the model generates climate outcomes (tons of carbon emitted and economic and health damages due to higher temperatures and pollution). These outcomes are generated when specific climate policies such as mitigation are analyzed, but also when other policies are analyzed that might have unanticipated climate impacts. The paper describes the changes made to the World Bank’s standard macro structural model, MFMod, in integrated climate outcomes, climate policies, and the economic impacts of climate on Pakistan’s economy. Notably, carbon-tax scenarios show that a \$20 carbon tax can reduce emissions in Pakistan by 36 percent by 2050. Gross domestic product impacts could also be positive, if the revenues from the carbon tax were used to reduce reliance on heavily distorting taxes. The model also quantifies associated co-benefits from reduced local air pollution and better health and productivity outcomes. In the absence of action to restrain climate change, the model suggests that increased temperatures and rain variability could reduce output by as much as 10 percent compared with a scenario where global temperature rises were minimized.},

To identify parameters that could be used in such cases, a cointegrating panel approach is followed that yields a common long-run estimate of parameters for key equations (to test the theoretical restrictions imposed in the model) and short-run disequilibrium estimates that vary by country. This approach is preferred to pure calibration or Bayesian estimation, because the functional forms imposed in the panel are consistent with those used in the macro structural model.},

During the 1970s and 1980s, the Revised Minimum Standard Model (RMSM) was used for this purpose. The popularity of the RMSM was undoubtedly due to its simplicity, but that simplicity has also limited its usefulness. Introducing multiple economic agents in a consistent flow-of-funds framework allows the exploration of more policy options while preserving the useful features of the RMSM. This flow-of-funds version of the RMSM is known as the Revised Minimum Standard Model eXtended (RMSM-X). Although conceived as a working tool for country economists to facilitate their analysis of economic policy packages, the basic version of the RMSM-X generates all of the projections required for three activities within the World Bank.},

The models are used by country economists within the World Bank's Macroeconomics, Trade and Investment Global Practice to (i) generate country forecasts and (ii) simulate various policies. Each model has a similar structure and functional form, with variation reflecting data availability and economic specialization (notably for oil exporters). Although the functional forms are similar, the parameters are country specific and estimated at the country level. Forecasts across countries are live-linked, with the export market growth of each country calculated as a trade-weighted average of imports of each of its trading partners. Remittance inflows and outflows are balanced across countries through a similar mechanism. Other cross-country linkages come through the real effective exchange rate and export and import prices, which are a function of world commodity prices and local cost considerations.},

	abstract = {This issue of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy is the second in the Rebuilding Macroeconomic Theory project. The papers in the first issue proposed specific improvements to the New-Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (NK-DSGE) framework, in response to the events of the 2008 crisis. This issue goes further. We, as editors, now argue that a new multiple-equilibrium and diverse (MEADE) paradigm is needed for macroeconomics. It will emphasize that economies can have more than one stable outcome, and study why. It will require using both toy models, which enable a quick, first-pass, intuitive understanding of a question, and policy models (aka structural economic models) which develop a detailed empirical understanding of the economy. We argue that the seminal IS/LM, Solow–Swan, Ramsey, Real Business Cycle, Taylor, and Clarida/Galí/Gertler models have all been toys, as is the benchmark NK-DSGE model. In the past the models have adapted as the questions changed, and the NK-DSGE model must now do this since it has failed to capture both the salient aspects of the lead-up to the 2008 crisis and the slow recovery afterwards. The way forward in the MEADE paradigm will be to start with simple models, ideally two-dimensional sketches, that explain mechanisms that can cause multiple equilibria. These mechanisms should then be incorporated into larger DSGE models in a new, multiple-equilibrium synthesis. All of this will need to be informed by closer fidelity to the data, drawing on lessons obtained from detailed work on policy models.},
