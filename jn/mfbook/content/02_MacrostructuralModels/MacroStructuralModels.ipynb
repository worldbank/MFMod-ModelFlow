    "# Macrostructural models\n",
    "\n",
    "The economics profession uses a wide range of models for different purposes.  Macro-structural models (also known as semi-structural or Macro-econometric models) are a class of models that seek to summarize the most important interconnections and determinants of economic activity in an economy. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE), and Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models are other classes of models that also seek, using somewhat different methodologies, to capture the main economic channels by which the actions of agents (firms, households, governments) interact and help determine the structure, level and rate of growth of economic activity in an economy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, organizations, including the World Bank, use all of these tools, privileging one or the other for specific purposes. Macrostructural models like those that comprise the `MFMod` framework are widely used by Central Banks, Ministries of Finance; and professional forecasters to generate forecasts and to undertake policy analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "While macrostructural models fell out of favor with academic economists, they remain central tools in policy making and forecasting circles. In a series of discussions and papers Olivier Blanchard {cite:t}`blanchard_future_2018`, former Chief Economist at the International Monetary Fund, concluded that academic economists are wrong to discard out-of-hand policy models such as macro-structural models.  Those conclusions were reinforced in a recent collection of papers by leading academics {cite:t}`vines_rebuilding_2020` that argued that until a better framework could be developed, \"policy-makers need to rely on structural economic models and the detailed econometric work which they embody\" rather than the DSGE models favored by academics."

    "This Chapter provides a high-level introduction to macro-structural models in general and the `MFMod` system in particular. It presents them as systems that balance theoretical rigor with practical utility, enabling comprehensive insights into economic systems. Macrostructural models are widely used by policymakers for scenario analysis and forecasting and `MFmod` is the main framework used by the World Bank for analyzing the economic progress and policies of developing economies.\n",

    "It notes that these models are effectively a system of equations that describe the economic transactions (flow of funds) that occur in the economy, including those captured by the main economic accounting systems, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* GDP and its subcomponents from the National Accounts expenditure, production, and income accounts.\n",
    "* Detailed government, monetary policy, and balance of payments accounts.\n",
    "* General equilibrium flow of funds linking households, firms, government, and foreign sectors.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mathematically, a macro-structural model is a system of equations comprised of two kinds of equations and three kinds of variables. Variables that are determined by an equation are classified by the type of equation that determines them, variables without an equation are deemed exogenous as they are determined outside of the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Models in the `MFMod` framework are comprised of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```Identities``` variables: that are determined by an identity: an equation that is a well-defined accounting rule that always holds. The famous GDP formula Y=C+I+G+(X-M) is one such identity, it indicates that GDP at market prices is **definitionally** equal to Consumption plus Investment plus Government spending plus Exports less Imports.  The equation is an identity and the variable (Y in this instance) is also called an identity.\n",

    ":::{index} single: Behavioral Equations\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "* ```Behavioral``` variables that are determined by equations that attempt to statistically summarize the economic (vs accounting) relationship between variables, where the structure of the statistical relationship is derived from economic theory, but the sensitivities of different causal variables is estimated from the data. Thus, the neo-classical equation that says Real Consumption is determined by households maximizing their utility through the consumption of goods and services subject to a budget constraint is a behavioral equation. Because these behavioral equations only explain part of the variation in the variable they seek to explain, and because the sensitivities of variables to the changes in other variables are uncertain, these equations and their parameters are  typically estimated econometrically and are subject to error.\n",

    ":::{index} single: Exogenous variables\n",
    ":::\n",
    "* ```Exogenous``` variables: do not have equations and are not determined by the model. Typically there are set either by assumption or from data external to the model.  For an individual country model, the exogenous variables might include the global price of crude oil because the level of activity of a small economy itself is unlikely to affect the world price of oil. Similarly, the rate of growth of GDP in other economies may be treated as an exogenous variable, important to determining exports in the modeled developing country unlikely to be affected by activity in the modeled country (small country assumption). \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{Note}\n",
    "What dictates whether a variable is exogenous or endogenous is not set in stone. A variable that is exogenous in one model may be endogenous in another. For example in an single-country model, GDP growth of other countries may be exogenous, but in a multi-country model the GDP growth of those other countries would likely be endogenous (determined by the model).\n",
