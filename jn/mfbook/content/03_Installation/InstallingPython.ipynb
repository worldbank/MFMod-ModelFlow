    "`Python` is a powerful, versatile and extensible open-source programming language. It is widely used for artificial intelligence applications, interactive web sites, and scientific processing. As of May 2024, the `Python Package Index` (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contained over 530,000 packages that extend its functionality [^pythonLibrary]. ModelFlow is one of these packages.\n",

    "**MiniConda** is a more streamlined distribution, providing only the essential components for running python. It offers faster installation and a smaller footprint, making it suitable for users who prefer a more streamlined environment and want more control over package selection. Features that are in Anaconda, but not installed by miniconda by default, can be added manually.\n"

If you are already familiar with python, plan to use it with `ModelFlow` and have space limitations `MiniConda` is probably the best solution for you.  For users new to python `Anaconda` may be a better solution.\n",
