    "The method `.totdif()` returns an instance of the **`totdif` class**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works by solving the model multiple times, each time modifying one of the right-hand side variables and calculating the impact on all dependent variables. By default, it uses the values from the `.lastdf` `DataFrame` as the shock values and the values in `.basedf` as the baseline (initial) values. Separate simulations are run for every exogenous (or exogenized) variable that has changed between the two `DataFrame`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "For advanced users, the right-hand side (RHS) variables can be grouped into user-defined blocks. This feature is particularly useful when there are many changes, as it helps identify the primary causal pathways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the attribution analysis is stored in the `.res` property of the `totdif` class instance. This property contains a dictionary with two keys: `'level'` and `'growth'`. These represent the impacts of each exogenous variable or group on the `level` and `growth` metrics, respectively.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In certain circumstances, it can also be helpful to group exogenous variables into categories that are analyzed as a whole. For example, in a model with many countries, it might make sense to group shocks by country. Alternatively, it could be useful to group shocks by type across all countries.
