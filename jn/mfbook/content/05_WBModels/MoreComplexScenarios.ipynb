    "A complex scenario is developed as deficiencies in initial scenarios are unearthed.  Scenarios presented include:\n",

    "1) The introduction of a simple carbon tax (a simple shock of an exogenous variable) three exogenous variables in this case.  \n",
    "2) Upon examining results, it is recognized that the initial nominal shocks loses impact over time because of inflation. Therefore, the shock is re-estimated as an ex-ante real shock (i.e. the initial shock is up-scaled over time in line with inflation to keep its real value constant). \n",
    "3) This example is judged imperfect because it does not account for the in-scenario inflation impacts. In a third scenario, the model equations are adjusted so that the ex-post inflation rate is used to maintain the real-value of the Carbon tax. \n",

The impact is not at an unchanging level, reflecting in part adaptation within the economy. Of particular import is what is being done with the revenues from the Carbon tax. As the structure of GDP (shifts to less carbon intensive activities) carbon tax revenues fall even as the Carbon Tax rate rises. \n",

As a result,  emissions are higher than they would have been had GDP remained unchanged. For the Pakistan model, the positive impact of the Carbon tax is mainly explained by co-benefits, notably reduced reliance on more distortionary taxes such as payroll taxes and because of reductions in informality and due to health and productivity benefits from lower pollution levels (see {cite:author}`burns_climate_2021`(2021) for more details how these effects operate in the Pakistan model).\n"
