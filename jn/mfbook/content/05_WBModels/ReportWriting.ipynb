    "It is possible to specify a table that is too large for conventional display systems.  For example, a table of data taken from  a model that covers 100 years could, if the dates run vertically, span more than 1 page, or one that covers many data series might overrun the right hand side of a computer screen, pdf file or printed page.\n",
    "Displaying such tables in `Jupyter Notebooks` or other computer-based displays is straightforward because `Jupyter Notebook` will allow the user to scroll content that does not fit on the page. However, in `LaTeX` documents or printed materials, tables that overrun the page can become impossible to read. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this issue, several strategies can be employed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Drop Middle Columns**: This involves removing several columns from the middle of the table that may not be critical to the reader’s understanding, helping to condense the table into a more manageable size.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Display Tables in Chunks**: Specify a rule for breaking the table into multiple smaller tables, each covering a shorter time span. This not only makes each segment easier to fit on a page but also can help readers digest the information in smaller, more focused increments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Display a Slice of Data**: Rather than showing the entire timeline, you can display a specific segment or 'slice' of the data that is most relevant to the analysis at hand. This approach focuses the reader's attention and avoids overwhelming them with too much information at once.\n",
