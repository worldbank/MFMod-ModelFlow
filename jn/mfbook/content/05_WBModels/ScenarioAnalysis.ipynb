In so doing they give valuable insights to policy makers concerning potential policies.  This chapter introduces users to scenario analysis using World Bank models and `ModelFlow`.

    "This chapter presents examples of running simulations. Four types of simulation are covered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Permanent Exogenous Shocks**: These involve either *shocking an exogenous variable* (say World oil prices) or *deactivating an equation* and treating its dependent variable as if it were exogenous and shocking it directly.\n",
    "2) **Endogenous Shocks**: In these shocks, a behavioral equation is left active, but its *add-factor is shocked* in order to impact its trajectory. This might be used when an external shock is expected, but the analyst wants the subsequent (and even contemporaneous) behavior of the variable to react to second-round effects that occur in the model (i.e., an increase in investment by one firm could be modelled using an add-factor, but as GDP rises, other firms would normally also want to increase their investment to meet the additional demand. By using the add-factor this second order effect is enabled).\n",
    "3) **Temporary Exogenous Shocks**: Here a behavioral equation can be temporarily deactivated — give the endogenous variable an initial shock by setting its level directly to a specific level for a given period — but then reactivated in subsequent periods so that the variable's trajectory is affected by second- and third-round effects of the initial shock. This differs from the add-factor shock in that there is no endogenous reaction of the shocked variable during the period it is exogenized.\n",
    "4) **Mixed Scenarios**: More complex scenarios that combine one or more shocks.\n",
