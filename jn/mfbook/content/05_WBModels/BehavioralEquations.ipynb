    "The Error correction specification was developed to deal with two important problems in econometric equations.\n",
    "1. Many time-series data tend to increase over time. As a result, a regression of one series on another series tends to have good fit even if the two variables are not really connected economically. For example, the price of cookies tends to rise over time because of inflation. Similarly, the quantity of screws produced in the manufacturing sector tends to rise over time because of increased population and, therefore, demand for manufactured goods. Regressing screw production on cookie prices will show a strong but spurious correlation. \n",
    "2. Purely short run models focus on growth or differences and get around the problem of the spurious correlation arising from regressing two unrelated series that each have a trend. While, these explained the short run deviations, stringing the estimated growth rates together could result in implicit levels that were unstable because they were not anchored to the long-run relationship between variables dictated by underlying economic theory (or empirical behavior).\n",
