    "`Jupyter Notebook` is an application for creating, annotating, simulating and working with computational documents.  Originally developed for python, the latest versions of EViews also support `Jupyter Notebooks`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`Jupyter Notebook` offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience and can be a great environment for documenting the work you are doing, and trying alternative methods of achieving desired results.  Many of the methods in ```ModelFlow``` have been developed to work well with `Jupyter` Notebook. Indeed this documentation was written as a series of `Jupyter Notebooks` bound together with the [Jupyter Book package](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html).\n",
    " \n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is not the only way to work with `ModelFlow` or Python.  As users become more advanced they are likely to migrate to a more program-centric IDE (Interactive Development Environment) like Spyder or Microsoft Visual Code.  \n",

    "However, to start, Jupyter Notebooks is a great environment in which to follow work done by others, try out code, and tweak the codes of others to fit your own needs."

    "\n",
    "- **What is Jupyter Notebook**:\n",
    "  - A tool for creating and sharing computational documents that integrate code, text, and visualizations.\n",
    "  - Ideal for prototyping, debugging, and documenting workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Getting Started**:\n",
    "  - Activate the Python environment and launch Jupyter Notebook from the command line.\n",
    "  - Navigate to your desired working directory and start a new notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Notebook Structure**:\n",
    "  - Composed of cells that can contain code, markdown, or outputs.\n",
    "  - Cells have two modes: Edit (for writing code or text) and Command (for running cells or managing notebook structure).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - Write and execute Python code interactively.\n",
    "  - Use Markdown for formatted text, including headers, bullet points, and inline mathematics.\n",
    "  - Render complex mathematical equations with LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shortcuts and Tips**:\n",
    "  - Use keyboard shortcuts to navigate, edit, and execute cells efficiently.\n",
    "  - Combine code, results, and documentation in one notebook for replicability.\n",
