# \# MFMod in Modelflow



This repository houses macrostructural models produced for various clients, as well as a webified version of the Manual "The World Bank's MFMod Framework and Modelflow", that explains in detail how to use the ModelFlow python package with the macroeconomic models of the World Bank.



The manual describes the implementation of the World Bank’s MFMod Framework \[Burns et al. (2019)] using the open source modeling package ModelFlow. (Hansen, 2023 https://ibhansen.github.io/doc/index). The impetus for this manual and the work that it summarizes was to make available to a wider constituency the work that the Bank has done over the past several decades to build and develop Macro-structural models1 for developing countries.



The manual exists in a variety of formats:

• a PDF version (available [here](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/099120125152010503))

• an html version (available here (https://worldbank.github.io/MFMod-ModelFlow/index.html)). The html version

of the manual includes live links to:

– the Jupyter Notebooks that comprise this book

– links to the Jupyter notebooks that comprise the book on google colab where they can be run using the colab

infrastructure

– links to World Bank github site (https://github.com/worldbank/MFMod-ModelFlow) that hosts the repository

for the manual and the models that have been released

Note access to individual Jupyter notebooks and collab versions of the notebooks are provided by the icons that appear

at the top of each html page:

The first icon links to colab. The second to the github site. The third allows downloads of the Jupyter Notebook and PDFs

of the jupyter notebook currently being viewed in the html document. The final two icons shift the html to fulls-screen

mode and switch between dark and light screen modes.



Chapter eight (p. 76) in the pdf version of the manual explains how to access the models from the repository using the ModelFlow python package.
